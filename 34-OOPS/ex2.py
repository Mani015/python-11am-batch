# There can be some functionality that relates to the class,
# but does not require any instance(s) to do some work, static methods can be used in such cases.
# A static method is a method which is bound to the class and not the object of the class.
# It canâ€™t access or modify class state.
# It is present in a class because it makes sense for the method to be present in class.
# A static method does not receive an implicit first argument.
