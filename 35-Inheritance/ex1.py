# Inheritance
# Benefits of inheritance are:
# It represents real-world relationships well.
# It provides the reusability of a code. We donâ€™t have to write the same code again and again. Also, it allows us to add more features to a class without modifying it.
# It is transitive in nature, which means that if class B inherits from another class A, then all the subclasses of B would automatically inherit from class A.
# Inheritance offers a simple, understandable model structure.
# Less development and maintenance expenses result from an inheritance.

# Python Inheritance Syntax
# Class BaseClass:
#     {Body}
# Class DerivedClass(BaseClass):
#     {Body}

# There are  5-types of here:
# 1.single level inheritance
# 2. multiple level
# 3.multi-level Inheritance
# 4.hierarical inheritance
# 5.Hybrid Inheritance
