# Encapsulation is a mechanism of wrapping the data (variables) and code acting on the data (methods) together as a single unit.
# In encapsulation, the variables of a class will be hidden from other classes,
# and can be accessed only through the methods of their current class.



# Python Access Modifiers
# Let us see the access modifiers in Python to understand the concept of Encapsulation and data hiding âˆ’

# public
# private
# protected
# The public Access Modifier
# The public member is accessible from inside or outside the class.
